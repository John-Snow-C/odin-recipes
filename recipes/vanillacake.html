    <h3>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>175g (6oz) margarine or softened butter</li>
            <li>175g (6oz) caster sugar</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>175g (6oz) self-raising flour, sifted</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 180Â°C (gas mark 4)
                <br>Lightly grease an 18cm (7in) round cake tin
                <br>with a little extra butter or margarine
                <br> and cut a piece of greaseproof paper or non-stick baking parchment
                <br> to fit the base of the tin
            <li>Put all the ingredients into a large mixing bowl
                <br> and beat with a wooden spoon or a hand-held mixer for 1 minute,
                <br>or until just combined
                <br><strong>It's important not to beat the batter too much
                <br>just long enough to make it smooth</strong></li>
            <li>Pour or spoon the mixture into the tin
                <br>smooth the top and bake on the middle shelf of the oven
                <br>for about 45-50 minutes
                <br>The cake is cooked when it looks well risen and golden
                <br>the top should spring back when lightly touched with a fingertip
                <br>Another test is to insert a skewer into the centre of the cake
                <br>it should come out clean</li>
            <li>Let the cake sit in the tin for 5 minutes
                <br>then gently run a knife around the edge
                <br>and turn it out onto a wire rack to cool
                <br>Serve dusted with icing sugar.</li>
        </ol>
